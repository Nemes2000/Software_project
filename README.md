The world of unworldly virologists

Changes:

The gloves after 3 uses peel off and disappear.
In some labs, you can automatically become infected with the bear virus (unless you have a protective agent or cloak on), which causes the infected person to start doing the bear dance
 - the bear dancer (abbreviated: bear) moves with random movements
 - the bear destroys the materials in every warehouse in its path
 - the bear smears every virologist in its path with the bear virus (its supply is inexhaustible), against which the usual defenses work
The bear can be "cured" in one way: a tool called an axe found in shelters can also be used. Anyone hit with this dies, but is no longer infected. The axe wears off after one use and no longer works, but it takes up space until it is thrown away.

Default: 

In a devastating biological disaster, everyone lost their sight. Virologists roam the city looking for a cure.
The genetic code of various viruses is scratched on the wall of a laboratory. For a virologist to know the genetic code, he has to go to that laboratory and probe the genetic code. Based on this, it will be possible to produce either a vaccine or the virus itself.

Based on an already known code, the virus or the vaccine (common name: agent) can be created, but for this the virologist must have the necessary amount of amino acids and nucleotides (common name: material). Amino acids and nucleotides can be collected in various warehouses, but each person can only carry a limited amount of them. If the amount of material collected reaches this limit, you cannot take any more.

A virologist can use the produced agent in a short time: he can apply it to himself or to another virologist, but only if the virologist performing the application can touch the other. The applied agents are only effective for a given period of time, they decompose after the expiration of the time, and their effect ceases.

There are many types of agents. There is one that causes vitus dance: the victim begins to move uncontrollably, with random movements. There is one that protects against certain agents of other virologists affecting the virologist under the effect of the agent. There is an agent that paralyzes, so while the effect of the agent lasts, the victim cannot do anything (paralyzes). Some make the victim forget the genetic codes they have already learned.

Virologists can also collect protective equipment during their migration. Protective equipment is scattered throughout the city. To obtain a piece of equipment, the virologist must enter the appropriate shelter and put on the protective equipment. The equipment only protects the virologist wearing it. The effect of the equipment lasts as long as the virologist wears it. However, a maximum of 3 pieces of equipment can be worn at the same time.

There are many types of protective equipment. There is a protective jacket that keeps agents away with an efficiency of 82.3%. There is a bag that increases the virologist's ability to collect materials. There are gloves with which the applied agent can be thrown back onto the grease.

Virologists can meet each other during their wanderings. In an encounter, they can walk past each other, smear an agent on the other virologist, or, while the other virologist is in a paralyzed state, take the other's supplies and equipment.

The game is won by the virologist who learns all the available genetic codes first. The playing field forms a grid of polygons with different numbers of sides, virologists can walk on its fields (open space, warehouse, shelter, laboratory, etc.).
